# Download Organization Script

This script is designed to help organize your Downloads folder. It sorts files into different directories based on their file types.

## How it works

The script scans all files in your Downloads directory and moves them into appropriate subdirectories. The subdirectories are:

- PDF
- Images
- Videos
- Audio
- Software
- Text
- Compressed
- Other

Files are sorted into these directories based on their file extensions.

## How to use

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script using the command `python main.py`.

Please note that the script currently only supports Windows and paths are hardcoded. You may need to modify the paths in the script to match your system configuration.
